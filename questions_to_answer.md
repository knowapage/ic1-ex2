Why did I choose CE over EE?
Well I have always been interested in computers, especially high performance gaming computers. 
I have always wanted to learn more about how they work and to be on the cutting edge of 
technology. Now my interests are more into embedded systems and keeping track of how technology
becomes more prevalent in society.
